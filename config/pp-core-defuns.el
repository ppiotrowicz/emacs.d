(defmacro add-hook! (hook &rest func-or-forms)
  "A convenience macro for `add-hook'.

HOOK can be one hook or a list of hooks. If the hook(s) are not quoted, -hook is
appended to them automatically. If they are quoted, they are used verbatim.

FUNC-OR-FORMS can be a quoted symbol, a list of quoted symbols, or forms. Forms will be
wrapped in a lambda. A list of symbols will expand into a series of add-hook calls.

Examples:
    (add-hook! 'some-mode-hook 'enable-something)
    (add-hook! some-mode '(enable-something and-another))
    (add-hook! '(one-mode-hook second-mode-hook) 'enable-something)
    (add-hook! (one-mode second-mode) 'enable-something)
    (add-hook! (one-mode second-mode) (setq v 5) (setq a 2))"
